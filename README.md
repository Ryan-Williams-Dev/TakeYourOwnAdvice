# TakeYourOwnAdvice

[Visit App](https://tyoa.netlify.app/)

## About
 
Take your own advice is a mental health tool. Designed to capture your positive outlook and optimistic wisdom on the days you are feeling great, then feed it back to you in your own words on the days where you need a boost.

The main dashboard prompts a user to say if their overall feeling is positive or negative. In both cases a user will then see a page where they can select any applicable emotion tags they feel relevant. 

If a user selected postive they will then be presented with a prompt. The prompt will ask the user to provide some advice to someone who may be struggling with feelings opposite to the postive feelings currently experienced by the user.

If a user selected negative, they will be presented with some advice relating to the emotion tags they picked in the previous page. The app will seach for and prioritise any relevant advice the user themself has previously submitted. However, if the user has no matching advice, it will pick from the closest match it can find amongst other user's responses and present that message, with the author kept anonymous.
